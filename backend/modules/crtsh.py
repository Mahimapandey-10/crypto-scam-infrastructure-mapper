def get_certificates(domain: str) -> list:

    Queries crt.sh — the public Certificate Transparency log database.
    No API key needed. Completely free. No rate limits for normal use.

    What are Certificate Transparency logs?
    ----------------------------------------
    Every time anyone registers an SSL certificate for a website,
    it gets logged permanently in a public database. This was created
    so that nobody can secretly issue fake certificates. We exploit this
    for investigation — scammers can't hide their domains from this log.

    Returns a list of certificate records, each containing:
      - domain      : the domain name on the certificate
      - issuer      : who issued the cert (Let's Encrypt, Comodo, etc.)
      - not_before  : when the cert became valid (tells us domain birth date)
      - not_after   : when it expires

    the first victim transaction, that's a strong indicator
    of when the operation started — useful for the timeline.
